# Language-Modeling
NLP assignment to train several language models (which ones?) and evaluate them on two test corpora.

Made on python 3.7

To run this code, make sure the text files are stored in the directory data/ and then run setup.py
Once setup.py completes, there should be preprocessed versions of the text files in data/preprocs and pickle dump files
of the models in data/models.

Then run questions.py which whill print the results to results.txt
#consider a mother fucking script that does it all ALSO setup.py should take in an argument giving it path to data

#IO.py
Save and load the vocabs for the models.

#prep.py
preprocessing and padding of all the files

#train.py
process files to create the language models

#prob.py
calculate the probabilities.

#perplexity.py
calculate the perplexities.

#setup.py
self explanitory, but it sets everything up.

#questions.py
answer some quesions bitch
